      <h2>First Camera I used</h2>
      <p>I once borrowed a Canon camera from a classmate and really liked the world in the viewfinder.</p>

      <h2>My First DSLR</h2>
      <p>Started with Nikon D7500. It taught me ISO, aperture, and patience.Simple, but inspiring.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="column">
      <h2>Now: D850</h2>
      <p>I chose the Nikon D850 because it not only has excellent durability and professional-grade image quality, but also reflects the respect and understanding of the Nikon brand for photographers. Just as Nikon's brand promotional song "Welcome Home" expresses - every time I pick up this camera to record my life, I feel a sense of belonging, as if the world is unfolding before my eyes, waiting for me to discover and treasure it with my lens.</p>
